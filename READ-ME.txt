To use our medical chatbot, you must do the following:
1. Download the PROLOG first through this website: https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable, make sure that the installer is compatible with your machine.
2. Open the swipl-win to start the PROLOG. (You can find it in the bin folder of swipl in Program Files directory)
3. Make sure that your working directory is in the same path where you have installed our .pl file. To do that:
	- type "working_directory(CWD, '[path of the .pl file]')." then enter. 
		Example: working_directory(CWD, 'D:/Downloads/PrologApp').
	- check if the directory has been changed by typing "pwd."
4. Compile the .pl first by typing "[mco2]."
5. Finally, run the PROLOG program by typing "start."

NOTE: PROLOG is case sensitive, make sure you type in lower case and put "." (period) in each input.


Thank you for using our medical chat bot! Have fun!
